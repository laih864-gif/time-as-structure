      <h3>The Garden of Forking Paths</h3>
      <p>I am a timorous man.</p>
      <h3>The Book of Sand</h3>
      <p>I felt the loneliness ringing me in, and I began fearing I'd never get back to Buenos Aires.</p>

    <article class="card fatigue">
      <h2>Exhaustion</h2>
      <h3>The Circular Ruins</h3>
      <p>This magic project had exhausted the entire expanse of his mind.</p>
      <h3>The Garden of Forking Paths</h3>
      <p>For an undetermined period of time I felt myself cut off from the world, an abstract spectator.</p>
      <h3>The Book of Sand</h3>
      <p>Loneliness does not worry me; life is difficult enough, putting up with yourself and with your own habits.</p>
