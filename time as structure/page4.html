      <h2>Identity Revelation</h2>
      <p class="meta">From <em>The Circular Ruins</em> — The Fire God Reveals the Dream</p>

      <p>
        This multiple god revealed to him that his earthly name was Fire, and that in this circular temple
        (and in others like it) people had once made sacrifices to him and worshiped him, and that he would
        magically animate the dreamed phantom, in such a way that all creatures, except Fire itself and the
        dreamer, would believe him to be a man of flesh and blood. He commanded that once this man had been
        instructed in all the rites, he should be sent to the other ruined temple whose pyramids were still
        standing downstream, so that some voice would glorify him in that deserted edifice. In the dream of
        the man that dreamed, the dreamed one awoke.

      <p class="subhead">The Final Revelation</p>
      <p>
        In a dawn without birds, the wizard saw the concentric fire licking the walls. For a moment, he
        thought of taking refuge in the water, but then he understood that death was coming to crown his old
        age and absolve him from his labors. He walked toward the sheets of flame. They did not bite his
        flesh, they caressed him and flooded him without heat or combustion. With relief, with humiliation,
        with terror, he understood that he also was an illusion, that someone else was dreaming him.

      <h2>Time Revelation</h2>
      <p class="meta">From <em>The Garden of Forking Paths</em> — The Labyrinth Is Time</p>

      <p>
        “Here is the Labyrinth,” Albert said, pointing to a tall, laquered writing cabinet.
        “An ivory labyrinth?” I exclaimed. “A tiny labyrinth indeed…!”
        “A symbolic labyrinth,” he corrected me. “An invisible labyrinth of time. I, a barbarous Englishman,
        have been given the key to this transparent mystery.”

      <p class="subhead">The Theory of Branching Time</p>
      <p>
        “In all fiction, when a man is faced with alternatives he chooses one at the expense of the others.
        In the almost unfathomable Ts'ui Pen, he chooses — simultaneously — all of them. He thus creates various
        futures, various times which start others that will in their turn branch out and bifurcate in other
        times. This is the cause of the contradictions in the novel.”
      </p>

      <p class="subhead">Infinite Time Network</p>
      <p>
        “He believed in an infinite series of times, in a dizzily growing, ever spreading network of diverging,
        converging and parallel times. This web of time — the strands of which approach one another, bifurcate,
        intersect or ignore each other through the centuries — embraces every possibility.”

      <h2>Conceptual Collapse</h2>
      <p class="meta">From <em>The Book of Sand</em> — The Expanding Circle</p>

      <p>
        Twirl was continually proposing new areas of expansion, and don Alejandro always accepted. It was like
        being at the middle of a spreading circle, which grows ever larger and always farther away.

      <p class="subhead">The Impossible Representation</p>
      <p>
        Planning an assembly to represent all men was like fixing the exact number of platonic types — a puzzle
        that had taxed the imagination of thinkers for centuries.
      </p>

      <p class="subhead">The Congress as Totality</p>
      <p>
        I know that I am alone; I know that in the whole world I am the only keeper of that secret event — the
        Congress — whose memory I can no longer share. I am now the last member of that Congress. It is undeniable
        that all men are members of that Congress — that there is not a single being on earth who is not — but I
        know I am a member in a very different way.
