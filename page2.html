      An ant colony does not live in a straight line of time. Inside the anthill, thousands of small movements happen at once. One ant leaves a trail, another follows, and soon the path divides into many directions. Some paths end, some cross, and some begin again. The colony grows through repetition and variation, like a living labyrinth.
    </p>

    <p>
      This reminds us of Borges’ idea of branching time. In <em>The Garden of Forking Paths</em>, time does not move forward in only one way; it splits into many possible futures. The anthill works in a similar way. Every small choice creates another path. No single ant controls the whole design, yet together they build something complex and almost endless.
    </p>

    <p>
      Like the dreamer in <em>The Circular Ruins</em>, who slowly creates a man through repeated nights of dreaming, the ants build their world piece by piece. The colony becomes a structure made from countless small actions. In this sense, the anthill shows that time is not only something we move through. It is something we build, layer by layer, like tunnels under the earth.
